<!-- ADD YOUR ABOUT PAGE TEXT BELOW THIS LINE -->
The UK Barcode of Life (UKBOL) project comprises a network of UK government agencies, biodiversity institutions and individual scientists engaged in DNA barcoding of the biota of the United Kingdom. There are approximately 75,000 eukaryote species in the UK and we aim to assemble and curate a comprehensive library of standardized DNA sequences (DNA barcodes) as a reference resource for research and management of this biodiversity. DNA barcoding provides a powerful tool for species identification from any type of tissue, any life stage, even from bulk samples or trace DNA left in the environment (eDNA). Reference DNA barcodes are linked to expertly identified voucher specimens in scientific collections with data deposited in a public, open-access database (BOLD). Our effort is an integrated part of the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL) and works closely with the Darwin Tree of Life project (DToL).
